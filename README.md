Project 1:1 for CS 315 Game Programming by Andrew Dickinson

## How to Play
  -Launch Ball -(Space bar)
  -Rotate Left -(Left Arrow)
  -Rotate Right -(Right Arrow)
  
 The power level of the ball is idicated by the bars at the top of the screen (Max 5).

## Project Report Iteration 1

### Reflection
I very much enjoyed working in godot while doing this project. My previous game design experience came in handy when it came to project structure, also I kind of knew 
what to look for when I hit a wall. This being said a lot of game programming can be a bit frustrating when you are playing around with stuff. Dumb mistakes like 
applying the force in the wrong dirrection still happen from time to time for me. 

### Self-Assessment
- [X] D-1: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
- [X] D-2: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file, no unnecessary files tracked, and all commit messages following <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">our style guide</a>.
- [X] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [X] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
- [X] C-5: The player can fire the projectile.
- [X] C-6: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [X] C-7: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [X] C-8: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
- [X] B-1: The project report is complete.
- [X] B-2: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).
- [X] B-3: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [X] A-1: The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing.
- [X] A-2: There is a visual indicator showing the angle at which the projectile will fire.
- [X] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.

This work therefore merits a A.
